# Root Agent Instructions

This repository contains the source code for the Best Ball rankings web app.

## Project Requirements
- Build a web page that loads fantasy football rankings from the **Rankings** tab of the Google Sheet at [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rNouBdE-HbWafu-shO_5JLPSrLhr-xuGpXYfyOI-2oY/edit?gid=1912864828#gid=1912864828).
- Pull the sentiment score from the **Sentiment** tab. The sentiment score is stored in **column F** of that sheet.
- Display a table showing these fields in order: **Ranking**, **Position**, **Team**, **Player**, **Sentiment**.

## Development Notes
- Thoroughly check for regressions and merge conflicts before committing and pushing code. Error-free code is supremely important; take the time needed to ensure quality.
- Always run available tests or checks (currently `git status --short`) to confirm a clean working tree before completing a PR.
